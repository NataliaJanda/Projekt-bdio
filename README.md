# Notes-app

This repo is forked from uni project I was contributing to.

It will serve the same purpose as previous project,
it will be a code/note sharing app.

There will be change in technology,
I'm going to try move it from react to angular,
backend will stay the same (postgres and springboot)

## What will be different then

During my time working on it as uni project,
we as a team threw few ideas aside:

-note spaces (smt like folders)
-sharing note spaces
-working the same file in the same time
-notifications about someone changing/editing notes
-and many more ...

Moreover as I learned during my internship that Testing is very important,
I'm going to try write test for all this code that was writen.

## What other technologies I'm planing to use

-kafka or rabitmq for notifications
-creating pipelines for ci/cd using jenkins or github actions (not sure now)
